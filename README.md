Problem Statement:
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

Business Goal:
Build a regression model using Advance regression methods like Ridge and Lasso regression to predict the price of the houses with the available independent variables.

This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

Model Objective:
Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house
How well those variables describe the price of a house.
Determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

Tasks:
Data Understanding, Data preparation and EDA:
    Importing and understanding of the data
    Check the data quality, missing values if any, removing of duplicates and outlier analysis
    Create dummy variables or label encoding and derive new metrics
    Transformation of the target variables
    
Model Building and Evaluation:
    Test-train split and Feature scaling
    Data modelling using RFE
    Ridge and Lasso Regression to find the top feature variables and finding the optimal alpha value
